# IoT - Asset Tracking with Leaflet and ArcGIS

In this Code Pattern composite, we'll demonstrate how to track assets and visualize incoming sensor data from the Watson IoT Platform on a mapping application using Leaflet.js and ArcGIS. This is a continuation of the "Smart City" code pattern composite. This application targets two primary use cases:

The first use case is tracking moving IoT assets. This can be anything that has a GPS module attached, whether that be a shipping truck, a tagged wild animal, etc.

The second use case is to visualize sensor data associated with various connected IoT devices. This sensor data can represent any measurable physical property, such as temperature, sound, air quality, humidity, etc.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Publish sensor and location data to the Watson IoT Platform
* Import historical CSV datasets for visualization
* Persist data in a Cloudant Database
* View the status of IoT assets in a map

## Flow
<!--Add new flow steps based on the architecture diagram-->
<!-- 1. Upload and Instantiate smart contracts via the Bluemix Network Monitor
2. Deploy the node application locally or on bluemix
3. Input connection information such as service credentials, endpoint, etc into configuration form
4. Submitting form sends a request to pull a json file containing the connection profile. The information from this profile is used to create a "monitoring" client with administrative privileges

5. If form data is valid, user should be able to execute Chaincode operations, view individual blocks and their data, and request state of registered Assets -->

1. User registers an "end node" via the mapping UI or a MQTT message. This end node represents a trackable asset capable of publishing location and sensor data.

2. Express backend subscribes to Watson IoT Platform channel corresponding to one or more end nodes.

3. End Node continuously publishes JSON object containing location, time, and sensor data to Watson IoT Platform

```
{
  d: {
    node_id: "asset1",
    longitude: "-118.417392",
    latitude: "34.100057",
    timestamp: "2018-06-30T07:10:55.174Z",
    sensor: {
      sound: "72"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Message persists in Cloudant DB

5. Front end (Leaflet.js) updates marker location on map

## Install Prerequisites:

### Node.js packages
If expecting to run this application locally, please continue by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime and NPM. If your system requires multiple versions of Node for other projects, we'd suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch between Node versions. NVM can be installed with the following commands
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
# Place next three lines in ~/.bash_profile
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
nvm install v8.9.0
nvm use 8.9.0
```

To run the UI locally, we'll need to install a few node libraries which are listed in our `package.json` file.
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/): Open source library for interactive mapping
- [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/): Client package to subscribe to Watson IoT Platform and handle incoming messages

Install the listed node packages by running `npm install` in the project root directory.
```
npm install
```

Start the application with
```
node app.js
```

# Steps
There are two methods we can use to deploy the application, either use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` steps **OR** create the services and run locally.
1. [Clone repository](#1-clone-the-repository)
2. [Setup repository codebase locally](#2-deploy-application-locally) OR [Deploy to IBM Cloud](#2-deploy-application-to-ibm-cloud)
3. [Create Watson services with IBM Cloud](#3-create-services)
<!-- 4. [Upload and Instantiate Chaincode](#4-upload-and-instantiate-chaincode) -->
5. [Start the Application](#5-run-the-application)
6. [Retrieve service credentials](#6-obtain-service-credentials)
7. [Configure and run the application](#7-ui-configuration)

## 1. Clone the repository

Clone the `iot-mapping` project locally. In a terminal, run:

```
git clone github.com/IBM/iot-mapping
```

## 2. Deploy Application to IBM Cloud

1. To deploy the application to IBM Cloud, we'll need to leverage the IBM Cloud CLI. Ensure the cli is installed using the prerequisites section above, and then run the following command to deploy the application
```
bx cf push
```

2. To see the app and services created and configured for this Code Pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard, or run `bx cf apps` and `bx cf services` in the terminal. The app should be named `iot-mapping` with a unique suffix.

## 2. Deploy Application locally
Install the IoT Mapping node packages by running `npm install` in the project root directory.
```
npm install
```
Start the application with
```
npm start
```
<!-- ### Docker setup (optional)
If you have Docker installed, you can install these dependencies in a virtual container instead. Run the application with the following commands, and then skip to [Step 5](#5-configure-credentials)
```
docker build -t monitoring_ui .
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 monitoring_ui
``` -->

> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button.

<!-- there are MANY updates necessary here, just screenshots where appropriate -->

## 3. Create Services

Next, we'll need to deploy our service instances using the IBM Cloud dashboard.

### Watson IoT Platform

Navigate to the IBM Cloud dashboard at [https://console.bluemix.net/](https://console.bluemix.net/) and click the `Catalog` button in the upper right
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0CctlyI.png"  data-canonical-src="https://i.imgur.com/0CctlyI.png">
</p>

In the search bar type "Internet of Things" and click the icon titled `Internet of Things Platform`.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pjZ3jrI.png" >
</p>

Select the pricing plan and click `Create`. If deploying on an IBM Lite account, be sure to select the free "Lite" plan

#### Additional Configuration: Generate Watson IoT service credentials
After being provisioned, the IoT Platform service will need a bit of additional configuration, as we'll need to generate a set of credentials for connecting to the broker. We can do so by entering the IoT Platform dashboard, selecting `Devices` from the left hand menu, and then clicking the `Add Device` button.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fec24FG.png"  data-canonical-src="https://i.imgur.com/fec24FG.png">
</p>

Next, provide a device type and ID.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/REQfYIK.png"  data-canonical-src="https://i.imgur.com/REQfYIK.png">
</p>

The next few tabs (Device Information, Groups, Security) can be left as is with the default settings.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rycnjlF.png"  data-canonical-src="https://i.imgur.com/rycnjlF.png">
</p>

Clicking the `Finish` button will register a device and generate a set of credentials that can be used to publish messages to the IoT Platform. Be sure to take note of the Device type and Device ID, and place both in the `cfcreds.env` file.

We'll need to generate a different set of credentials to be able to publish and subscribe to the MQTT Broker
<!-- <p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A2A6yXW.png" width="650" height="450">
</p> -->

We can do so by selecting the `Apps` option in the left hand menu. Then, click the `Generate API Key` button
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/b9Iu9DS.png" width="650" height="450">
</p>

We can leave the fields in the `Information` blank and click next.
In the `Permissions` tab, we'll select the `Backend Trusted Application` role. Once this is selected, click `Generate Key`
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ss6jpOZ.png" width="650" height="450">
</p>

The result will give us an API Key and Authentication Token. These can be supplied as the username and password for a MQTT client. To make setup a bit easier, place these values in the `cfcreds.env` file as IOT_API_KEY and IOT_APP_AUTH_TOKEN
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hfnB1B8.png" width="650" height="450">
</p>

## 5. Obtain service credentials

Now that we've instantiated our Watson IoT Platform service instance and the corresponding MQTT credentials, we'll next need to place the credentials into a `.env` file in our application root directory. This will allow for the application to authenticate to the MQTT broker and listen for updates from registered IoT devices.

```
IOT_API_KEY=
IOT_AUTH_TOKEN=
IOT_ORG_ID=
IOT_DEVICE_ID=
IOT_DEVICE_TYPE=
IOT_EVENT=
```

<!-- We can obtain the Blockchain credentials by downloading

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Replace the credentials here with your own.
# Rename this file to .env before starting the app.

# Watson conversation
CONVERSATION_USERNAME=<add_conversation_username>
CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=<add_conversation_password>
WORKSPACE_ID=<add_conversation_workspace>

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_USERNAME=<add_discovery_username>
DISCOVERY_PASSWORD=<add_discovery_password>
DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=<add_discovery_environment>
DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID=<add_discovery_collection>

# Watson Natural Language Understanding
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_USERNAME=<add_nlu_username>
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_PASSWORD=<add_nlu_password>

# Watson Tone Analyzer
TONE_ANALYZER_USERNAME=<add_tone_analyzer_username>
TONE_ANALYZER_PASSWORD=<add_tone_analyzer_password>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000

``` -->


## 6. Run the application

1. Start the app locally with `node app.js`.

2. Enter the following URL in a browser: `http://localhost:3000/` </br>**Note:** If you run into an issue with the port already being used, set the `PORT` environment variable to the port you'd like to use.

</p>

<!--Include any troubleshooting tips (driver issues, etc)-->

## 7. Visualize assets in UI

Now, we can actually confirm that the UI is able to visualize asset locations and sensor data.

There are a few ways to import data to be viewed in the mapping application.

Each option requires the following
- A unique string identifier, corresponding to the specific IoT device.
- A set of Longitude/Latitude coordinates
- A timestamp, which should be represented as either the UTC epoch format or the ISO-8601 format.
- Sensor value(s) in a key/value format, ex. `sound: 65` (Optional)

The first option is to create a node manually. This can be done by clicking the `Add Node button and entering the required values. Once they have been entered, pressing `Create` should render a marker like so. A transparent circle will also be added if a sensor is provided, and the radius length is determined by the sensor value

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Mh5qgjf.png"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m8c2VIl.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

In a live scenario, these updates should come in the form of MQTT messages sent by associated IoT devices. Each device can broadcast an update by publishing a MQTT message with the following payload:

```
mqtt_pub -v -i "a:${IOT_ORG_ID}:client_pub1" -u "${IOT_API_KEY}" -P "${IOT_AUTH_TOKEN}" -h 'agf5n9.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com' -p 1883 -t "iot-2/type/${IOT_DEVICE_TYPE}/id/${IOT_DEVICE_ID}/evt/assetMapper/fmt/json" -m '{
    "d" : {
    "node_id": "node2",
    "lat": "-118.317392",
    "long": "34.100057",
    "timestamp": "2018-06-30T07:10:55.174Z",
    "sensor": {
      "sound": "72"
    }
  }
}'
```

We can also bulk import CSV datasets. In this example, we'll use data from tracking a herd of zebra in Botswana, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.343). This file can be loaded by clicking the `Import CSV File` button.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fwSzA7n.png"  data-canonical-src="https://i.imgur.com/fwSzA7n.png" width="750" height="450" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Once the file is loaded, headers will need to be selected to identify which columns correspond to each individual node id, location, and timestamp. This can be done by manually inspecting the file

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CIZqhYG.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Next, select the headers in the `Select Dataset Columns` form

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QG4qhZY.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Once the columns have been selected, markers for each node id should be visible like so.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/b5DzIxP.png"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

We can also click the `Show all paths` button to draw the path traversed by each asset.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/33PbBLN.png"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

If there are multiple datapoints associated with an asset, we can use a "range slider" to trace back and view an assets path. As the slider is adjusted, each marker should update their location and sensor identifier. Also, the corresponding timestamp should be shown in the bottom right corner of the map.
